In absence of request approval on invision app to check the corresponding pixel values to have a pixel-strict design of the landing page, I tried to improvise using some approximate pixel values I could grab from using a pixel measurement chrome extension. I know it might not be as requested but tried to make it as similar to the model landing page as possible.
